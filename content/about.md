Hi! I am Tate :)

I am studying brain engineering and computer science at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/html/kaist/01.html). I’ve mainly worked as a software developer at several companies. Since 2023, I’m working on research to develop the digital therapeutics with proven principles. If you are interested, I hope that you would check my [CV](https://tate.kim/resume.pdf).

  

I welcome new relationships. Feel free to contact me by [twitter](https://twitter.com/yongtae923), [instagram](https://instagram.com/yongtae9230), or [email](mailto:yongtae@kaist.ac.kr).
